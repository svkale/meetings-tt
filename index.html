		<p>
			This API (<a href="./join">join</a>) takes you to the meeting using the link (if pre-provided by the course instructor) if the lecture is going on, or there are five minutes to start the lecture.
		</p>
		The following features are not present, and are considered in the scope of the project:
		<ul>
			<li>Take to the meeting scheduled as extra lecture.</li>
			<li>Cancel an existing lecture.</li>
			<li>Give user the choice when one lecture is just ending and the other is just starting.</li>
			<li>Show timetable for the week with extra or cancelled lectures.</li>
			<li>Show all the links course wise.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The code is published on <a href="https://github.com/svkale/meetings-tt">github</a>. The timetable and the links are taken from the same repository in the form of json files. Any additions / extra feature ideas / creative pull requests are welcome.
			<strong>
				It is highly recomended to not use this API for exams, as this is can create confusion.
